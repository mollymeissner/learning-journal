# .js
*Access the content on the page
*Modify the content on the page
*Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
*React to events triggered by the web or browser

*Programming is speaking the language of the computer
*You can teach the machine to do a new trick

# Script:
*Series of Instructions. The Computer runs different sections of code in response to the situation
*Define the goal, design script, and code each step
*Frist, create a Flowchart: a visual of tasks and steps

## Objects:
*Properties: characteristics like name and value
*Events: the computer's way of saying, "This just happened"
*Methods: represents how people or other things interact with an object in the real world

*It's like making a recipe: Input (ingredients), Processing (instructions), and Output (the results)!

## Expressions:

## Evaluates into a single value

### There are 2 types of Expressions:
1. Assign a value to a variable
1. Use 2 or more values to return a single variable

### Expressions rely on Operators

## Operators:

## Assignment Operator:
*Assign a value to a variable
*ie.: color='beige';

## Arithmetic Operator:
*Perform basic math
*ie.: total = (2+4) * 10;

String Operator:
*combine two strings
*ie.: greeting = 'Howdy';

## Function: lets you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
  *ie.: function sayHello() {
          document.write('Hello!');
*If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function
  *(rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### Parameters: pieces of info passed to a function: width, height
*ie.: function getArea(width, height) {
        return width * height;
      }

### return value: the response to a function

### Calling the function: when you ask it to perform a task

### Arguments: values or variables, inside the parentheses that follow its name
*Arguments as values:
 *getArea(3, 5);
 
*Arguments as variables:
 *wallWidth = 3;
 *wallHeight = 5;
 *getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);
