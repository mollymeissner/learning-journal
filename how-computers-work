# How Computers Work:

### Binary numbers are the backbone of how computers INPUT, PROCESS, and STORE, and OUTPUT information.

*Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the info
*Using a wire, you can represent binary numbers (zeros and ones)
*The more bits there are, the more complex information is represented
*Exen Text, Images, and Sound can be represented by binary numbers
*Circuits are tiny electronic components formed together that perform complex calculations

### Everything you do with technology requires lots of info to be processed quickly. Underneath the complexity is lots of tiny circuits that turn binary signals into websites, games, etc.

*CPU: Central Processing Unit: To process info
*Input: CPU calculates how to display input
*Memory: CPU relies on stored info
*Output: CPU sends info to output
