# Operators:

* ===  : Strict equal to
* !==  : Strict not equal to

### Operands are values or variables placed outside the operator
* ie: (score >= pass)
* (operand, comparison operator, operand)

### Comparison Operators: can be an expression - returning single values of true or false
* ie: ((score1 + score2) > (highScore1 + highScore2))

### Local Operators: allows you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
((5 < 2) && (2 >+ 3))
&&: Local And (the operator tests more than 1 condition)
||: Logical Or
!: Logical Not

Short-circuit evaluation:
