**Bio:** As a former Software Business Development Representative at Algolia, I'm excited to challenge my brain to learn the skills of a Software Developer at Code Fellows. I'm ready to _learn how to learn_.

## A "growth mindset" is the perception that through you can further develop your abilities and intelligence through hard work and dedication.

**Reminders on how to keep a growth mindset:**
1. When it gets tough, or when you're confused, that's when the real learning begins
2. You learn more and achieve more when you're challenging yourself and pushing yourself to do what's uncomfortable
3. Studying, practicing, persisting, and listening to feedback leads to growth

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mollymeissner/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mollymeissner/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
