What I've learned about CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 

Example of css:
Header {
background-color: purple;}

Where to put CSS:
In-line: type css into the html file
External: on a separate style sheet
In the header, type:
    "<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />"

An external style sheet is helpful because you can change the style on one sheet, rather than having to change it for each html page.
