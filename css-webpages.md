# HTML5 and CSS

## HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
### Structure
* HTML Elements tell the browser the info between the opening and closing tags
* Opening tag: <p>
* Closing tag: </p>
* <p>Have a great day</p>

### Attributes: What kind of info you're supplying about the content
* <p lang = "en us"> Paragraph text </p>

### Structural Markup:
    * the elements you use to describe Headings and Paragraphs
### Semantic Markup:
    * provides extra info, like where the emphasis is places in a sentence, that something is a quotation, the meaning of acronymns, etc.

## CSS: (Cascading Style Sheets):
* What I've learned about CSS

* Example of css:
* Header {
    background-color: purple;
    }

* Where to put CSS:
* In-line: type css into the html file
* External: on a separate style sheet
* In the header, type:
    "<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />"

* An external style sheet is helpful because you can change the style on one sheet, rather than having to change it for each html page.
